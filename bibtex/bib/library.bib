It provides an in-depth coverage of various approximate density-based nonlinear filters in discrete time developed particularly for handling the uncertainties induced by potential target maneuvers as well as nonlinearities in the dynamical systems commonly encountered in target tracking. An emphasis is given to more recent results, especially those with good potential for tracking applications.},

abstract = {In safety-of-life applications of satellite navigation, the protection level (PL) equation translates what is known about the pseudo-range errors into a reliable limit on the positioning error. The current PL equations for satellite-based augmentation systems (SBAS) rely on Gaussian statistics. This approach is very practical: the calculations are simple and the receiver computation load is small. However, when the true distributions are far from Gaussian, such a characterization forces an inflation of the PLs that degrades performance. This happens in particular with errors with heavy tail distributions or for which there is not enough data to evaluate the distribution density up to small quantiles. We present a way of computing the optimal protection level when the pseudo-range errors are characterized by a mixture of Gaussian modes. First, we show that this error characterization adds a new flexibility and helps account for heavy tails without losing the benefit of tight core distributions. Then, we state the positioning problem using a Bayesian approach. Finally, we apply this method to PL calculations for the wide area augmentation system (WAAS) using real data from WAAS receivers. The results are very promising: vertical PLs are reduced by 50\% without degrading integrity.},

abstract = {Advances in the development of micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) have made possible the fabrication of cheap and small dimension accelerometers and gyroscopes, which are being used in many applications where the global positioning system (GPS) and the inertial navigation system (INS) integration is carried out, i.e., identifying track defects, terrestrial and pedestrian navigation, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), stabilization of many platforms, etc. Although these MEMS sensors are low-cost, they present different errors, which degrade the accuracy of the navigation systems in a short period of time. Therefore, a suitable modeling of these errors is necessary in order to minimize them and, consequently, improve the system performance. In this work, the most used techniques currently to analyze the stochastic errors that affect these sensors are shown and compared: we examine in detail the autocorrelation, the Allan variance (AV) and the power spectral density (PSD) techniques. Subsequently, an analysis and modeling of the inertial sensors, which combines autoregressive (AR) filters and wavelet de-noising, is also achieved. Since a low-cost INS (MEMS grade) presents error sources with short-term (high-frequency) and long-term (low-frequency) components, we introduce a method that compensates for these error terms by doing a complete analysis of Allan variance, wavelet de-nosing and the selection of the level of decomposition for a suitable combination between these techniques. Eventually, in order to assess the stochastic models obtained with these techniques, the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) of a loosely-coupled GPS/INS integration strategy is augmented with different states. Results show a comparison between the proposed method and the traditional sensor error models under GPS signal blockages using real data collected in urban roadways.},

abstract = {INS/GNSS integration is a well known technique in navigation and, in general, in time-Position-Velocity-Attitude (tPVA) trajectory determination. It is also known, that INS and GNSS are complementary and that the key to their integration is the correct calibration of the Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensors, of the IMU's Inertial Sensor Assembly (ISA) system parameters (axes misalignments and center of navigation), and of the IMU-to-GNSS system parameters (eccentricity vectors). Calibration is performed both at the manufacturer's facilities prior to shipping and \&\#x201C;on-the-job,\&\#x201D; i.e., together with navigation. Classical INS calibration has two parts: INS error modeling and actual INS calibration once an INS error model is available (also called INS calibration model) either at the manufaturer's or on-the-job. INS error modeling is about understanding the error features \&\#x2014; systematic and random \&\#x2014; of an IMU and its result uses to be dynamic models \&\#x2014; Stochastic Differential Equations (SDE) and white noise amplitude \&\#x2014; of the main error sources like biases, scale factors and misalignment angles. INS calibration is about solving for the unknowns (states) of the SDE calibration model together with the unknown states of the SDE of motion. The quality of INS calibration is dependent on the mission dynamics. In classical INS/GNSS navigation, the INS calibration model is dynamics independent; i.e., SDEs formulas and white noise figures are derived following a number of established procedures and then kept fixed. However, it can be shown, that the error features and the INS error calibration model of an IMU change from mission to mission or, more to the point, from one to another type of dynamics. It is therefore natural, to investigate the relationship between IMU errors and motion dynamics and, once this is understood, use this knowledge to improve the performance of INS/GNSS tPVA trajectory determination. In this paper we present a method for IMU error analysis and its first results. It consists of using a reference IMU (REF) together with the IMU under test (IUT) for the simultaneous measurement of REF and ITU signals. First, we show how the sensor random behavior changes with dynamics for tactical and low-cost grade IMUs with respect a navigation grade one. Second, we introduce a procedure to analyze the error of the dynamic dat. The procedure is based on inertial data analysis tools as the Allan Variance applied to the errors of the target IMU with respect to the reference IMU.},

@article{Mahler2003a,
abstract = {The theoretically optimal approach to multisensor-multitarget detection, tracking, and identification is a suitable generalization of the recursive Bayes nonlinear filter. Even in single-target problems, this optimal filter is so computationally challenging that it must usually be approximated. Consequently, multitarget Bayes filtering will never be of practical interest without the development of drastic but principled approximation strategies. In single-target problems, the computationally fastest approximate filtering approach is the constant-gain Kalman filter. This filter propagates a first-order statistical moment - the posterior expectation - in the place of the posterior distribution. The purpose of this paper is to propose an analogous strategy for multitarget systems: propagation of a first-order statistical moment of the multitarget posterior. This moment, the probability hypothesis density (PHD), is the function whose integral in any region of state space is the expected number of targets in that region. We derive recursive Bayes filter equations for the PHD that account for multiple sensors, nonconstant probability of detection, Poisson false alarms, and appearance, spawning, and disappearance of targets. We also show that the PHD is a best-fit approximation of the multitarget posterior in an information-theoretic sense.},

abstract = {The navigation accuracy is seriously affected by installation errors of accelerometers in Gyroscope Free Strap-down Inertial Navigation System(GFSINS). So, the installation errors have to be calibrated before used and the output errors of accelerometers must be compensated while GFSINS is on working. In this paper, consider a 12-accelerometer GFSINS constituted with four three-axis accelerometers, a new position error calibration method based on the invariance of a vector module value in different coordinates and a sensitive direction error calibration method based on the principle of coordinate transformation are proposed. And the position errors are calibrated first and then to calibrate the sensitive direction error with a same set of turntable experiment data. Against with the error calibration order, the sensitive direction errors are compensated first and the next is to compensate the position errors. The details of calibration and compensation algorithm are given in this paper. At last, these two algorithms are simulated and the simulation result shows that the calibration and compensation algorithms are useful and could compensate most accelerometers' output errors caused by installation errors.},

abstract = {Attitude determination systems utilizing low cost MEMS sensors are increasingly becoming important due to its advantages in terms of the quickly improved precision, robust, high dynamic response and more significantly inexpensive costs of development and usage. However the large noises inherent in low cost MEMS sensors degrade the derived attitude precision if utilized through the conventional methods, e.g. initial alignment, strapdown inertial navigation mechanization. Therefore the novel application approach suitable for MEMS needs to be investigated. This paper describes an attitude determination system that is based on low cost MEMS inertial sensor, a triad of magnetometers and a commercial GPS receiver. Two main issues are addressed in the paper; firstly determination of the attitude initials, the algorithm is based on a quaternion formulation, a representative of attitude, of Wahbapsilas problem, whereby the error quaternion becomes the estimated state and is corrected by two observations of the earth magnetic field and gravity respectively. After the estimates converge, the derived attitude parameters are employed to initialize the inertial navigation calculations. Due to the large noises in MEMS sensor, there is a demand for external velocity and/or position corrections in the MEMS navigation calculations when system experiences translational motions. Hence secondly, GPS solutions are integrated in a Kalman filter by providing external velocity and position observations. A Kalman dynamic model is designed appropriate for MEMS sensor noise characteristics. The bias and drift are estimated by the integrated Kalman filter, which enables the online calibrations of MEMS sensor. The proposed approach has been developed and its efficiency is demonstrated by various experimental scenarios with real MEMS data and they are compared with Novatel SPAN-IMU reference.},

abstract = {Inexpensive fixed wing UAV are increasingly useful in remote sensing operations. They are a cheaper alternative to manned vehicles, and are ideally suited for dangerous or monotonous missions that would be inadvisable for a human pilot. Groups of UAV are of special interest for their abilities to coordinate simultaneous coverage of large areas, or cooperate to achieve goals such as mapping. Cooperation and coordination in UAV groups also allows increasingly large numbers of aircraft to be operated by a single user. Specific applications under consideration for groups of cooperating UAV are border patrol, search and rescue, surveillance, communications relaying, and mapping of hostile territory. The capabilities of small UAV continue to grow with advances in wireless communications and computing power. Accordingly, research topics in cooperative UAV control include efficient computer vision for real-time navigation and networked computing and communication strategies for distributed control, as well as traditional aircraft-related topics such as collision avoidance and formation flight. Emerging results in cooperative UAV control are presented via discussion of these topics, including particular requirements, challenges, and some promising strategies relating to each area. Case studies from a variety of programs highlight specific solutions and recent results, ranging from pure simulation to control of multiple UAV.

The nonlinear relations between the direction cosine matrix and the quaternion are linearized, and a variant of the extended Kalman filter is used to estimate the difference between the quaternion and its estimate. With each measurement this estimate is updated and added to the whole quaternion estimate. This operation constitutes a full state reset in the estimation process. Filter tuning is needed to obtain a converging filter. The second algorithm presented uses the normality property of the quaternion of rotation to obtain, in a straightforward design, a filter which converges, with a smaller error, to a normal quaternion. This algorithm changes the state but not the covariance computation of the original algorithm and implies only a partial reset. Results of Monte-Carlo simulation runs are presented which demonstrate the superiority of the normalized quaternion.},

@article{Wendel2006,
abstract = {During the last years, there is an increasing demand for cheap and easy to operate platforms for surveillance and reconnaissance purposes. Therefore, the development of micro aerial vehicles is receiving an increasing attention. However, VTOL-MAVs often show an inherent instability that makes at least an automatic stabilization necessary, because otherwise the operator would not be able to keep these vehicles airborne. This requires the availability of navigation information, especially the vehicle's attitude has to be known. This paper addresses the development of an integrated navigation system based on MEMS inertial sensors and GPS for a VTOL-MAV. Special attention is paid to the handling of GPS outages. While usually periods without GPS aiding can be bridged using the unaided strapdown solution, the poor quality of the MEMS inertial sensors prohibits this approach here. Therefore, during GPS outages the accelerometer data is interpreted as approximate measurements of the local gravity vector. Additionally, the usage of a magnetometer providing measurements of the Earth's magnetic field is motivated and discussed. Finally, flight test results illustrate the performance of the resulting system, proving that the achieved attitude accuracy is sufficient for the automatic control of the MAV. This holds in situations with permanent GPS loss and dynamic maneuvering, too. ?? 2006 Elsevier SAS. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In general, standalone global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) receiver architectures cannot provide a position accuracy suitable for use in vehicular applications in urban canyon scenarios. Specifically, GNSS signals are affected by the surrounding objects, such as high buildings, trees, and so on, which introduces multipath errors. Multipath arises from the reception of reflected or diffracted signals, possibly in addition to the line-of-sight signal, and is one of the most detrimental error sources in GNSS positioning applications. Multipath distributions in the urban canyon area are measured and characterized in this paper. In particular, the Doppler and code phase delay under different conditions are assessed as a function of vehicle speed and signal power, which are different from previous calibration metrics. Specifically, multipath directional-dependence phenomenon (i.e., the variation resulting from the direction of travel of the user) is observed during this process, and the multipath maximum Doppler offset and minimum Doppler offset are derived and verified by the real data. The multipath distribution will eventually affect the search strategy (i.e., search space size, coherent integration time) utilized in the high sensitivity receiver.},

However, there still is uncertainty in how to design the multiple models used by an IMM estimator. In this context, this paper compares three maneuver models, namely, variable process noise, variable state dimension, and discrete acceleration inputs via computer simulations. The first two modeling techniques belong to the design approach using multiple bandwidths whereas the latter technique utilizes matched filters. The three models exhibit characteristic errors throughout a maneuver, which are termed n-, L-, and u-shaped, respectively. Compared to total root mean squared (RMS) errors, a time-equalized RMS (eRMS) may be more appropriate for a maneuvering target. The total and equalized RMS values are illustrated for the IMM under the three maneuver models for performance evaluation and filter tuning.},

abstract = {A vital necessity for any kind of inertial navigation system (INS) is the alignment of its axis with the vehicle body frame (VBF). Civilian vehicle navigation has strict requirements with respect to cost, size, reliability, and ease of implementation of the system. Microelectromechanical system (MEMS) inertial sensors have satisfied the cost and size requirements for civilian vehicle navigation; however, reliability and ease of implementation of these low-cost and miniaturized navigation systems are still parts of major research and investigation. This paper focuses on an important aspect of the ease of implementation for inertial sensors. From a civilian user perspective, accurately aligning the inertial system with respect to the vehicle, before every use, is not a desirable quality for a portable navigation system. In addition, it is not realistic to assume that even a careful user can achieve good alignment accuracy of the system. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the effects of misalignment errors that will produce errors in initial alignment and affect the navigation accuracy for two different inertial systems. The inertial systems are classified according to the number of sensors used in the system. The first system consists of three gyros and three accelerometers [full inertial measurement unit (IMU)], whereas the second system only has one gyro and two horizontal accelerometers (partial IMU).},

A navigation system with a low-grade inertial measurement unit and an accurate single-antenna Global Positioning System (GPS) measurement system is considered for observability analysis. Uncertainties in attitude, gyro bias, and GPS antenna lever arm were shown to determine unobservable errors in the position, velocity, and accelerometer bias. It was proved that all the errors can be made observable by maneuvering. Acceleration changes improve the estimates of attitude and gyro bias. Changes in angular velocity enhance the lever arm estimate. However, both the motions of translation and constant angular velocity have no influence on the estimation of the lever arm. A covariance simulation with an extended Kalman filter was performed to confirm the observability analysis.},

A nonlinear complementary filter is proposed that combines accelerometer output for low frequency attitude estimation with integrated gyrometer output for high frequency estimation. The raw accelerometer output includes a component corresponding to airframe acceleration, occurring primarily when the aircraft turns, as well as the gravitational acceleration that is required for the filter. The airframe acceleration is estimated using a simple centripetal force model (based on additional airspeed measurements), augmented by a first order dynamic model for angle-of-attack, and used to obtain estimates of the gravitational direction independent of the airplane manoeuvres. Experimental results are provided on a real-world data set and the performance of the filter is evaluated against the output from a full GPS/INS that was available for the data set.},

abstract = {In this paper, the fusion of GPS pseudorange and deltarange measurements with inertial sensor data is adressed. For many years, extended Kalman filters (EKF) have been applied for this task with great success. However, from a theoretical point of view, the EKF is a sub-optimal choice: The system dynamics model, which is given by the inertial navigation strapdown equations, as well as the pseudorange and deltarange measurement models are nonlinear. The EKF approximates the propagation of Gaussian random vectors through these nonlinear equations by a linear transformation. This allows to capture the variance-covariance matrix of the propagated Gaussian random vectors with first order accuracy only. The family of sigma-point Kalman filters (SPKF) offers an approximation of variance-covariance matrix which is accurate to at least second order. Therefore, the performance of EKF-based and SPKFbased tightly coupled GPS/INS systems is compared in numerical simulations. Different inertial sensor grades from MEMS to FOG and a variety of scenarios are investigated, including situations with less than four satellites in view. Additionally, the simulation results were confirmed by the post-processing of raw GPS and inertial sensor data that was recorded during a test drive. It was found that except for specific situations without practical relevance, EKF and SPKF offer an identical performance. This is due to the fact that for tightly coupled - as well as loosely coupled - GPS/INS integration the higher-order transformation terms are negligible, which is shown analytically.},

Sigma-point filters use a carefully selected set of sample points to more accurately map the probability distribution than the linearization of the standard extended Kalman filter (KKF), leading to faster convergence from inaccurate initial conditions in position/attitude estimation problems. The filter formulation is based on standard inertial navigation equations. The global attitude parameterization is given by a quaternion, while a generalized three-dimensional attitude representation is used to define the local attitude error. A multiplicative quaternion-error approach is used to guarantee that quaternion normalization is maintained in the filter.

abstract = {This paper presents an autonomous motion planning algorithm for unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) to navigate safely in dynamic, cluttered environments. The algorithm not only addresses hazard avoidance (HA) for stationary and moving hazards, but also applies the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (known as COLREGS, for COLlision REGulationS). The COLREGS rules specify, for example, which vessel is responsible for giving way to the other and to which side of the “stand-on” vessel to maneuver. Three primary COLREGS rules are considered in this paper: crossing, overtaking, and head-on situations. For autonomous USVs to be safely deployed in environments with other traffic boats, it is imperative that the USV's navigation algorithm obeys COLREGS. Furthermore, when other boats disregard their responsibility under COLREGS, the USV must fall back to its HA algorithms to prevent a collision. The proposed approach is based on velocity obstacles (VO) method, which generates a cone-shaped obstacle in the velocity space. Because VOs also specify on which side of the obstacle the vehicle will pass during the avoidance maneuver, COLREGS are encoded in the velocity space in a natural way. Results from several experiments involving up to four vessels are presented, in what we believe is the first on-water demonstration of autonomous COLREGS maneuvers without explicit intervehicle communication. We also show an application of this motion planner to a target trailing task, where a strategic planner commands USV waypoints based on high-level objectives, and the local motion planner ensures hazard avoidance and compliance with COLREGS during a traverse.},

This generalization reveals the close mathematical relationship between the nonlinear complementary filter and the more traditional multiplicative extended Kalman filter. In fact, the bias-free and constant gain multiplicative continuous-time extended Kalman filters may be interpreted as special cases of the generalized attitude estimator. The correspondence provides a rational means of choosing the gains for the nonlinear complementary filter and a proof of the near global asymptotic stability of special cases of the multiplicative extended Kalman filter.},

abstract = {An autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) can employ the inertial navigation system (INS) to determine its position. The measurement from the INS, which utilizes the accelerometers and gyroscopes, deteriorates with time due to the accumulation of errors in the sensors. To reduce the error growth in the INS, an external aiding source such as the DGPS or the differential GLONASS can be utilized. The loosely coupled system approach is usually implemented in integrating the information from the aiding source and the INS. The two main architectures in the loosely coupled systems are the forward Kalman filter (FKF) and the direct feedback Kalman (DKF) filters. In this paper we explore the possibility of using these techniques for an aided INS in the AUV application. The advantages and the disadvantages of using the FKF and the DKF are also discussed.},

@article{Mahony2008a,
abstract = {This paper considers the problem of obtaining good attitude estimates from measurements obtained from typical low cost inertial measurement units. The outputs of such systems are characterized by high noise levels and time varying additive biases. We formulate the filtering problem as deterministic observer kinematics posed directly on the special orthogonal group SO (3) driven by reconstructed attitude and angular velocity measurements. Lyapunov analysis results for the proposed observers are derived that ensure almost global stability of the observer error. The approach taken leads to an observer that we term the direct complementary filter. By exploiting the geometry of the special orthogonal group a related observer, termed the passive complementary filter, is derived that decouples the gyro measurements from the reconstructed attitude in the observer inputs. Both the direct and passive filters can be extended to estimate gyro bias online. The passive filter is further developed to provide a formulation in terms of the measurement error that avoids any algebraic reconstruction of the attitude. This leads to an observer on SO(3), termed the explicit complementary filter, that requires only accelerometer and gyro outputs; is suitable for implementation on embedded hardware; and provides good attitude estimates as well as estimating the gyro biases online. The performance of the observers are demonstrated with a set of experiments performed on a robotic test-bed and a radio controlled unmanned aerial vehicle.},

iterative estimation process. The attitude is estimated first and is
then available for position estimation. The indirect (error state) form
of the Kalman filter is developed for attitude estimation when applying
gyro modeling. The main benefit of this choice is that combined dynamic
modeling of the mobile robot and its interaction with the environment is
avoided. The filter optimally combines the attitude rate information
from the gyro and the absolute orientation measurements. The proposed
implementation is independent of the structure of the vehicle or the
morphology of the ground. The method can easily be transferred to
another mobile platform provided it carries an equivalent set of
sensors. The 2D case is studied in detail first. Results of extending
the approach to the 3D case are presented. In both cases the results
demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method},

abstract = {This paper provides a survey of modern nonlinear filtering methods for attitude estimation. Early applications relied mostly on the extended Kalman filter for attitude estimation. Since these applications, several new approaches have been developed that have proven to be superior to the extended Kalman filter. Several of these approaches maintain the basic structure of the extended Kalman filter, but employ various modifications in order to provide better convergence or improve other performance characteristics. Examples of such approaches include: filter QUEST, extended QUEST, the backwards-smoothing extended Kalman filter, and the interlaced extended Kalman filter. Filters that propagate and update a discrete set of sigma points rather than using linearized equations for the mean and covariance are also reviewed. A two-step approach is discussed with a first-step state that linearizes the measurement model and an iterative second step to recover the desired attitude states. These approaches are all based on the Gaussian assumption that the probability density function is adequately specified by its mean and covariance. Other approaches that do not require this assumption are reviewed, including particle filters and a Bayesian filter based on a non-Gaussian, finite-parameter probability density function on SO(3). Finally, the predictive filter, nonlinear observers and adaptive approaches are shown. The strengths and weaknesses of the various approaches are discussed.},

abstract = {The integration of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) with Inertial Navigation Systems (INS) has been very actively researched for many years due to the complementary nature of the two systems. In particular, during the last few years the integration with micro-electromechanical system (MEMS) inertial measurement units (IMUs) has been investigated. In fact, recent advances in MEMS technology have made possible the development of a new generation of low cost inertial sensors characterized by small size and light weight, which represents an attractive option for mass-market applications such as vehicular and pedestrian navigation. However, whereas there has been much interest in the integration of GPS with a MEMS-based INS, few research studies have been conducted on expanding this application to the revitalized GLONASS system. This paper looks at the benefits of adding GLONASS to existing GPS/INS(MEMS) systems using loose and tight integration strategies. The relative benefits of various constraints are also assessed. Results show that when satellite visibility is poor (approximately 50\% solution availability) the benefits of GLONASS are only seen with tight integration algorithms. For more benign environments, a loosely coupled GPS/GLONASS/INS system offers performance comparable to that of a tightly coupled GPS/INS system, but with reduced complexity and development time.},

abstract = {The control algorithm hierarchy of motion control for over-actuated mechanical systems with a redundant set of effectors and actuators commonly includes three levels. First, a high-level motion control algorithm commands a vector of virtual control efforts (i.e. forces and moments) in order to meet the overall motion control objectives. Second, a control allocation algorithm coordinates the different effectors such that they together produce the desired virtual control efforts, if possible. Third, low-level control algorithms may be used to control each individual effector via its actuators. Control allocation offers the advantage of a modular design where the high-level motion control algorithm can be designed without detailed knowledge about the effectors and actuators. Important issues such as input saturation and rate constraints, actuator and effector fault tolerance, and meeting secondary objectives such as power efficiency and tear-and-wear minimization are handled within the control allocation algorithm. The objective of the present paper is to survey control allocation algorithms, motivated by the rapidly growing range of applications that have expanded from the aerospace and maritime industries, where control allocation has its roots, to automotive, mechatronics, and other industries. The survey classifies the different algorithms according to two main classes based on the use of linear or nonlinear models, respectively. The presence of physical constraints (e.g input saturation and rate constraints), operational constraints and secondary objectives makes optimization-based design a powerful approach. The simplest formulations allow explicit solutions to be computed using numerical linear algebra in combination with some logic and engineering solutions, while the more challenging formulations with nonlinear models or complex constraints and objectives call for iterative numerical optimization procedures. Experiences using the different methods in aerospace, maritime, automotive and other application areas are discussed. The paper ends with some perspectives on new applications and theoretical challenges. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Its control tasks are empowered by computer vision technology. Visual sensors are robustly used for stabilization as primary or at least secondary sensors. Hence, UAV stabilization by attitude estimation from visual sensors is a very active research area. Vision based techniques are proving their effectiveness and robustness in handling this problem. In this work a comprehensive review of UAV vision based attitude estimation approaches is covered, starting from horizon based methods and passing by vanishing points, optical flow, and stereoscopic based techniques. A novel segmentation approach for UAV attitude estimation based on polarization is proposed. Our future insightes for attitude estimation from uncalibrated catadioptric sensors are also discussed.},

abstract = {GPS-denied aerial flight is a challenging research problem and requires knowledge of complex elements from several distinct disciplines. Additionally, aerial vehicles can present challenging constraints such as stringent payload limits and fast vehicle dynamics. In this paper we propose a new architecture to simplify some of the challenges that constrain GPS-denied aerial flight. At the core, the approach combines visual graph-SLAM with a multiplicative extended Kalman filter. More importantly, for the front end we depart from the common practice of estimating global states and instead keep the position and yaw states of the MEKF relative to the current node in the map. This relative navigation approach provides simple application of sensor measurement updates, intuitive definition of map edges and covariances, and the flexibility of using a globally consistent map when desired. We verify the approach with hardware flight-test results.},

A measurement equation is derived allowing to process the time differenced carrier phase measurements in the navigation Kalman filter.

abstract = {Misalignment between the inertial navigation system (INS) body axes and vehicle body frame (VBF) can incur serious errors in the integration of INS and a mechanical odometer of vehicle motion sensor (VMS) on vehicles. In this contribution, two INS/VMS integration architectures are discussed, including loosely coupled mode and tightly coupled mode. The aim is to offer solutions to the problem of INS-to-VBF alignment and figure out how the INS-to-VBF misalignment affects different integration architectures. In the first architecture, the VMS outputs and nonholonomic constraints are used to calculate the velocities and positions, leaving the INS with the role of determining the vehicle attitude. In such integration, INS-to-VBF alignment and calibration of VMS scale factor are implemented by a geometrical method in advance. In the second architecture, the INS and VMS are tightly integrated in a single Kalman filter to form corrections to the INS error states and corrections to the VMS error states. The advantages and shortcomings of these two architectures are comprehensively analyzed. Ground based experimental results show that INS-to-VBF misalignment leads to more errors in loosely coupled integration than tightly coupled integration.},

@article{Georgy2010a,
abstract = {To have a continuous navigation solution that does not suffer from interruption, GPS is integrated with relative positioning techniques such as odometry and inertial navigation. Targeting a low-cost navigation solution for land vehicles, this paper uses a reduced multisensor system consisting of one microelectromechanical-system (MEMS)-based single-axis gyroscope used together with the vehicle's odometer, and the whole system is integrated with GPS. This system provides a 2-D navigation solution, which is adequate for land vehicles. The traditional technique for this multisensor integration problem is Kalman filtering (KF). Due to the inherent errors of MEMS inertial sensors and their stochastic nature, which is difficult to model, the KF with its linearized models has limited capabilities in providing accurate positioning. Particle filtering (PF) has recently been suggested as a nonlinear filtering technique to accommodate arbitrary inertial sensor characteristics, motion dynamics, and noise distributions. An enhanced version of PF is utilized in this paper and is called the Mixture PF. Since PF can accommodate nonlinear models, this paper uses total-state nonlinear system and measurement models. In addition, sophisticated models are used to model the stochastic drift of the MEMS-based gyroscope. A nonlinear system identification technique based on parallel cascade identification (PCI) is used to model this stochastic gyroscope drift. In this paper, the performance of the PCI model is compared with that of higher order autoregressive (AR) stochastic models. Such higher order models are difficult to use with KF since the size of the dynamic matrix and the error-covariance matrix becomes very large and complicates the KF operation. The performance of the proposed 2-D navigation solution using Mixture PF with both PCI and higher order AR models is examined by road-test trajectories in a land vehicle. The two proposed combinations are compared with four other 2-D solu-
-
tions: a Mixture PF with the Gauss-Markov (GM) model for the gyro drift, a Mixture PF with only white Gaussian noise (WGN) for stochastic gyro errors, and two different KF solutions with GM model for the gyro drift. The experimental results show that the two proposed solutions outperform all the compared counterparts.},

abstract = {In many unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) applications a direct georeferencing is required. The reason can be that the UAV flies au- tonomous and must be navigated precisely, or that the UAV performs a remote sensing operation, where the position of the camera has to be known at the moment of the recording. In our application, a project called Mapping on Demand, we are motivated by both of these reasons. The goal of this project is to develop a lightweight autonomously flying UAV that is able to identify and measure inaccessible three-dimensional objects by use of visual information. Due to payload and space limitations, precise position and attitude determination of micro- and mini-sized UAVs is very challenging. The limitations do not only affect the onboard computing capacity, but they are also noticeable when choosing the georeferencing sensors. In this article, we will present a new developed onboard direct georeferencing system which is real-time capable, applicable for lightweight UAVs and provides very precise results (position accuracy $\sigma$<5cm and attitude accuracy $\sigma$<0.5 deg). In this system GPS, inertial sensors, magnetic field sensors, a barometer as well as stereo video cameras are used as georeferencing sensors. We will describe the hardware development and will go into details of the implemented software. In this context especially the RTK-GPS soft- ware and the concept of the attitude determination by use of inertial sensors, magnetic field sensors as well as an onboard GPS baseline will be highlighted. Finally, results of first field tests as well as an outlook on further developments will conclude this contribution. 1},

abstract = {Recently, there has been growing interest in developing unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) with advanced onboard autonomous capabilities. This paper describes the current state of the art in autonomous rotorcraft UAS (RUAS) and provides a detailed literature review of the last two decades of active research on RUAS. Three functional technology areas are identified as the core components of an autonomous RUAS. Guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) have received much attention from the research community, and have dominated the UAS literature from the nineties until now. This paper first presents the main research groups involved in the development of GNC systems for RUAS. Then it describes the development of a framework that provides standard definitions and metrics characterizing and measuring the autonomy level of a RUAS using GNC aspects. This framework is intended to facilitate the understanding and the organization of this survey paper, but it can also serve as a common reference for the UAS community. The main objective of this paper is to present a comprehensive survey of RUAS research that captures all seminal works and milestones in each GNC area, with a particular focus on practical methods and technologies that have been demonstrated in flight tests. These algorithms and systems have been classified into different categories and classes based on the autonomy level they provide and the algorithmic approach used. Finally, the paper discusses the RUAS literature in general and highlights challenges that need to be addressed in developing autonomous systems for unmanned rotorcraft. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract = {User requirements for the performance of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)-based road applications have been significantly increasing in recent years. Safety systems based on vehicle localization, electronic fee-collection systems, and traveler information services are just a few examples of interesting applications requiring onboard equipment (OBE) capable of offering a high available accurate position, even in unfriendly environments with low satellite visibility such as built-up areas or tunnels and at low cost. In addition to that, users and service providers demand from the OBEs not only accurate continuous positioning but integrity information of the reliability of this position as well. Specifically, in life-critical applications, high-integrity monitored positioning is absolutely required. This paper presents a solution based on the fusion of GNSS and inertial sensors (a Global Positioning System/satellite-based augmentation system/inertial navigation system integrated system) running an extended Kalman filter combined with an interactive multimodel method (IMM-EKF). The solution developed in this paper supplies continuous positioning in marketable conditions and a meaningful trust level of the given solution. A set of tests performed in controlled and real scenarios proves the suitability of the proposed IMM-EKF implementation as compared with low-cost GNSS-based solutions, dead reckoning systems, single-model EKF, and other filtering approaches of the current literature.},

A development of quaternion constraints necessary to independently constrain roll, pitch, yaw, bank angle, elevation angle, and/or azimuth angle is presented. For veri cation of simulation codes, a general closed-form solution to the quaternion formulation, for the case of constant rotation, is also presented. Additionally, a discussion is provided of numerical integration methods and numerical errors for the quaternion formulation. This discussion is especially important for simulations thatmay still utilize a common error reduction scheme originally developed for analog computers.},

Instead, IMU and GPS measurements are directly incorporated in the control law. An important feature of the proposed strategy, is that the accelerometer is used to measure the apparent acceleration of the vehicle, as opposed to only measuring the gravity vector, which would otherwise lead to unexpected performance when the vehicle is accelerating (i.e. not in a hover configuration). © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

We avoid the well-known topological obstructions to global stability by not confining the attitude estimate to SO(3), but rather estimating a full rotation matrix with nine degrees of freedom. We also show how the attitude can be estimated under a relaxed persistency-of-excitation condition, with a single vector measurement as a special case. Next, we use the attitude observer to construct a globally exponentially stable observer for gnss/ins integration, based on accelerometer, gyro, and magnetometer measurements, as well as gnss measurements of position and (optionally) velocity. We verify the stability properties of the design using experimental data from a light fixed-wing aircraft.},

abstract = {Vehicle position estimation for intelligent vehicles requires not only highly accurate position information but reliable and continuous information provision as well. A low-cost Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver has widely been used for conventional automotive applications, but it does not guarantee accuracy, reliability, or continuity of position data when GPS errors occur. To mitigate GPS errors, numerous Bayesian filters based on sensor fusion algorithms have been studied. The estimation performance of Bayesian filters primarily relies on the choice of process model. For this reason, the change in vehicle dynamics with driving conditions should be addressed in the process model of the Bayesian filters. This paper presents a positioning algorithm based on an interacting multiple model (IMM) filter that integrates low-cost GPS and in-vehicle sensors to adapt the vehicle model to various driving conditions. The model set of the IMM filter is composed of a kinematic vehicle model and a dynamic vehicle model. The algorithm developed in this paper is verified via intensive simulation and evaluated through experimentation with a real-time embedded system. Experimental results show that the performance of the positioning system is accurate and reliable under a wide range of driving conditions.},

We model the feature-based SLAM problem as a single-cluster process, where the vehicle motion defines the parent, and the map features define the daughter. Based on this assumption, we obtain tractable formulae that define a Bayesian filter recursion. The novelty in this filter is that it provides a robust multi-object likelihood which is easily understood in the context of our starting assumptions. We present a particle/Gaussian mixture implementation of the filter, taking into consideration the challenges that SLAM presents over target tracking with stationary sensors, such as changing fields of view and a mixture of static and dynamic map features. Monte Carlo simulation results are given which demonstrate the filters effectiveness with high measurement clutter and nonlinear vehicle motion.},

abstract = {Many applications can be envisioned for accurate, robust, and reliable navigation solution in challenging urban environments. Examples of existing and prospective applications include, but are not limited to, navigation, guidance, and control of autonomous vehicles (including both ground and aerial vehicles) for urban surveillance and reconnaissance; collection of geographical information system (GIS) data in cities; monitoring of urban infrastructure for situational awareness; and, precise automotive applications such as automated lane keeping. If used by themselves, none of the existing navigation technologies have the potential to fully satisfy the requirements for reliable and accurate navigation in urban environments. Hence, this paper develops a multi-sensor integrated solution that combines the complementary features of the Global Positioning System (GPS), laser scanner feature-based navigation, and inertial navigation for urban scenarios. GPS and laser scanner-based navigation ideally complement each other for urban navigation. The laser scanner-based navigation relies on the availability of structures (lines and surfaces) within the scan range (80 m, typically). Features (such as lines) are first extracted from laser scan images and then used for position and attitude determination. In urban areas, if there exists a building wall that blocks GPS signals, this wall creates a feature in the laser scan image. On the other hand, for open streets with limited features, the GPS signal is generally unobstructed. Thus, GPS and laser data can be combined into integrated solution architecture. The system architecture developed also exploits INS navigation states for improved solution robustness: e.g., for robust feature association between scan images and for coasting through instances where sufficient number of combined GPS/laser measurements is unavailable. A tightly coupled GPS/laser scanner/INS mechanization is developed and applied for centimeter- accurate traje-
-
ctory reconstruction. The paper uses live urban data to demonstrate that combined GPS and laser scanner data generally support the observability of navigation states at any part of the urban trajectory; and, for those limited cases where insufficient GPS/laser measurements are available, the INS coasting option can be efficiently utilized. Test results presented also show that the developed tightly coupled GPS/laser scanner/INS solution provides accurate trajectory reconstruction capabilities (one sigma error residuals are at a cm-level) in challenging urban environments.},

Longitude also has a discontinuity att180x. These properties may lead to large errors in many standard algorithms. Using an ellipsoidal Earth model also makes latitude/longitude calculations complex or approximate. Other common represen- tations of horizontal position includeUTMand local Cartesian ‘flat Earth’ approximations, but these usually only give approximate answers, and are complex to use over larger dis- tances. The normal vector to the Earth ellipsoid (called n-vector) is a non-singular position representation that turns out to be very convenient for practical position calculations. This paper presents this representation, and compares it with other alternatives, showing that n-vector is simpler to use and gives exact answers for all global positions, and all distances, for both ellipsoidal and spherical Earth models. In addition, two functions based on n-vector are presented, that further simplify most practical position calculations, while ensuring full accuracy.},

abstract = {A challenging problem in underwater acoustics is the detection and tracking of human divers. In order to assess the suitability of different tracking methods on this problem, an evaluation of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is required. This paper investigates the SNR of a human diver using two approaches. The first approach is a moment-based target power estimator which uses the amplitudes of measurements validated by the tracking method. The second approach is by means of the receiving operating characteristic (ROC). The integrated Probabilistic Data Association (IPDA) is used to track the diver. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first well-documented implementation of the IPDA on real data.},

abstract = {A simple approach to gyro and accelerometer bias estimation is proposed. It does not involve Kalman filtering or similar formal techniques. Instead, it decouples the estimation problem into two separate stages. At the first stage, inertial system attitude errors are damped by means of a feedback from an external aid. In the presence of uncompensated biases, the steady-state feedback rebalances those biases and can be used to estimate them. At the second stage, the desired bias estimates are expressed in a closed form in terms of the damping feedback. The estimator has only three tunable parameters and is easy to implement and use. The tests proved the feasibility of the proposed approach for the estimation of low-cost MEMS inertial sensor biases on a moving vehicle.},

abstract = {This paper presents an analysis of a proposed tightly coupled Inertial/GPS navigation system for UAV applications. An indirect, error state extended Kalman filter is employed to estimate vehicle position, velocity, attitude and IMU bias errors. The indirect configuration linearises the state transition matrix and greatly reduces the required feedback frequency. Standard GPS C/A code pseudo-ranges are used directly to update the Kalman filter. The advantage of this configuration arises in situations of poor GPS availability. Traditional loosely coupled filters can deliver no new information to the filter when the observed satellite number falls below four. In the tightly coupled con- figuration, all available information is delivered to the filter even in situations where only one satellite remains observable. The extension of the vehicle states to include IMU biases further improves navigation accuracy by constraining drift during the INS alone cycle and in periods of low GPS observability. Both algorithms are suited to a low cost implementation. Results from flight trials of the Brumby Mk. III UAV are presented.},

@article{Elkins2010,
abstract = {Many small boat operations can be considered in the categories of “dull, dirty, or dangerous” jobs that are appropriate for automation. Dull jobs include long-range missions or surveillance tasks that can cause physical or mental fatigue in the crew. In addition, operational considerations may limit a human operator's time, such as exposure to heat or cold or union rules on maximum hours per day or job. The marine environment can be a dirty one as well, with wind-driven salt spray damaging unprotected eyes. And military operations such as riverine patrol or interception of potentially hostile craft can be dangerous for a human crew. Robotic systems allowing autonomous small boat operations can be a good match by providing rugged systems that keep sailors out of harm's way and also display “digital acuity” in that their sensors will be as efficient in their first hour of patrolling as in their last. This paper describes work done to build and test an autonomy system allowing several different boats to perform significant missions both by themselves and in cooperative modes.},

This algorithm removes some of the conservatism built into the prior positioning algorithm of Baro/GPS integrated system. This paper focuses on analysis of accuracy and integrity performance of Baro/GPS integrated system. The results of simulation show that this algorithm can substantially improves navigation accuracy performance of the integrated system, especially in the vertical direction.

(1) Here x is a vector comprising the user position coordinates together with clock offset, t is a vector of tour pseudorange measurements, and H is a measurement matrix of partial derivatives H = fx\^{A} In fact the first fix of a Kalman filter provides a solution of this type. If more than four pseudoranges are available for extended batch processing, H-1 may be replaced by a generalized inverse (HTWH)-1HTW, where W is a positive definite weighting matrix (usually taken to be the inverse of the measurement covariance matrix). This paper introduces a new method of solution that is algebraic and noniterative in nature, computationally efficient and numerically stable, admits extended batch processing, improves accuracy in bad geometric dilution of precision (GDOP) situations, and allows a "cold start" in deep space applications.},

@article{Lynen2013,
abstract = {It has been long known that fusing information from multiple sensors for robot navigation results in increased robustness and accuracy. However, accurate calibration of the sensor ensemble prior to deployment in the field as well as coping with sensor outages, different measurement rates and delays, render multi-sensor fusion a challenge. As a result, most often, systems do not exploit all the sensor information available in exchange for simplicity. For example, on a mission requiring transition of the robot from indoors to outdoors, it is the norm to ignore the Global Positioning System (GPS) signals which become freely available once outdoors and instead, rely only on sensor feeds (e.g., vision and laser) continuously available throughout the mission. Naturally, this comes at the expense of robustness and accuracy in real deployment. This paper presents a generic framework, dubbed MultiSensor-Fusion Extended Kalman Filter (MSF-EKF), able to process delayed, relative and absolute measurements from a theoretically unlimited number of different sensors and sensor types, while allowing self-calibration of the sensor-suite online. The modularity of MSF-EKF allows seamless handling of additional/lost sensor signals during operation while employing a state buffering scheme augmented with Iterated EKF (IEKF) updates to allow for efficient re-linearization of the prediction to get near optimal linearization points for both absolute and relative state updates. We demonstrate our approach in outdoor navigation experiments using a Micro Aerial Vehicle (MAV) equipped with a GPS receiver as well as visual, inertial, and pressure sensors.},
